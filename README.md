# DuckGame.PersistentSettings

Saves your Duck Game match settings into DuckGame/Options/matchsettings.json

Optionally starts a multiplayer game when you go to the team selection screen right away,
however that'll need a direct edit of the option "StartOnline" in the settings file as I didn't add UI for it.
